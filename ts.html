    <div class="ter">
        Welcome to the TriPPy websites and mobile properties and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “Services”; more generally, the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”). The Services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance of the terms, conditions and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and represent that you have read and understood its terms. Please read this Agreement carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes. If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, you are not authorised to use the Services. If you have a TriPPy account and wish to terminate this Agreement, you can do so at any time by closing your account and no longer accessing or using the Services (a description of how to do so is available here)
<p>Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “TriPPy” refer to TriPPy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (“TriPPy”). “Services” as defined above refers to those provided by Tripadvisor or our corporate affiliates (TriPPy and such entities, when one or more are referred to, shall be collectively defined as the “TriPPy Companies”). For the avoidance of doubt, the websites are all owned and controlled by TriPPy.  However, some specific Services made available via the websites may be owned and controlled by TriPPy’s corporate affiliates, for example Services facilitating the booking of Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with third-party suppliers (see below). </p>
<p>
    The term “you” refers to the individual, company, business organisation or other legal entity using the Services and/or contributing Content to them. The Content that you contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred to variously as “your Content”, “Content of yours” and/or “Content you submit.”

The Services are provided solely to:

Assist customers in gathering travel information, posting Content and searching for and booking travel services and reservations; and
Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with customers and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the Tripadvisor Companies.
</p>
<p>
    We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to be referred to as “Account Holders”) of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with the Account Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement.
